This is exciting and interesting HR Analysis project Which I developed on POWER BI.

### Overview :
In this HR analysis project, Power BI was utilized to gain insights into various facets of the workforce. The primary objectives included understanding the total headcount, job titles distribution, gender ratio, age distribution, salary versus qualifications, and the company's growth trajectory.

### Key Findings :
Job Titles Distribution
Job titles were analyzed to comprehend the composition of different roles within the organization. This analysis helps in identifying the distribution of various positions and detecting any potential gaps or areas needing reinforcement.

#### Gender Ratio
A male versus female comparison was conducted to evaluate the gender diversity within the company. This insight is crucial for promoting equality and implementing gender diversity initiatives.

#### Salary vs. Qualification
An analysis of salary versus qualifications was performed to ensure that  compensation strategy is fair and competitive. This helps in assessing if employees are compensated in alignment with their educational qualifications and can highlight any disparities that may need to be addressed.

#### Growth of the Company
The growth of the company was analyzed by looking at historical headcount data over time. This analysis helps in understanding the expansion trajectory of the organization and planning for future growth strategies.

#### Visualization
Power BIâ€™s robust visualization capabilities were employed to create intuitive dashboards for each of these analyses. These visualizations facilitate easy comprehension and quick decision-making for HR managers and other stakeholders.
